## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass Partials, mixins and nesting
- [Styled Components](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is my first project i have used Sass and honestly i found it more enjoyable and easy to use & understand than tailwindcss. This is my personal take though and i will be using it alot in my projects. Let me link a tutorial that helped me understand Sass üëâüèΩ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb4Nnc6VtZI&t=7145s)
